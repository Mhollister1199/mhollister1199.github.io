    <head>About Me</head>
    <P> I'm a first year student at the unversity of Maine Orono.
        I'm enrolled in the business school and my major is in accounting.
        I like to eat tons of food and go to the gym.
        When I get freetime I long board or sleep.</P>
         <P>  I'm originally from Mass. and I came to this school primarily for an education but also to snowboard. I have snowboarded all over New England, so I'm pretty used to boarding on ice, but powder is my true love. MY favorite mountain that I've been to is Vail in Colorado.

      </P>
