My Favorite Dogs
</head>
<P>Dogs have always been able to turn my day from a bad one into a good one with one lick. Something about seeing the playful face of a pup with it's tail wagging never failed to bring a smile to my face. If there is ever a time when you or a friend needs a dog sitter my number is 774-212-2658, feel free to drop your dog off knowing it will be well accounted for.</P>

<P> One breed I have a special love for is golden retrievers. They are the dog of the American dream and that is enough said. I also have always wanted to own a rottweiler simply because it is a mans dog, all purpose with a loving side that makes this dog the perfect breed. If I had to choose another breed that I love I'd have to choose huskies. Just the fact that they love the snow is enough to win my love.</P>
