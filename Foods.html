Favorite Foods

<P>
Everyone loves pizza and yes I too love pizza but when I'm asked what my favorite foods are I have my own unique tastes that make my mouth water.</P>

<P> I'm an Italian and yes one of my favorite foods is pasta. I'm a person who can and will eat pasta two times a day seven days a week. With the pasta I like a nice big piece of chicken because I mean who doesn't like a nice big piece of chicken. For a sauce I like a good alfredo sauce but a good alfredo sauce is hard to come by so if I have to I'll settle for a good red meat sauce.</P>

<P>Another food that I could eat almost every day is American chop suey. The mix of all of the veggies with the fresh macaroni and an abundance of beef is divine. The only time that I don't like American chop suey is when my dad's girlfriend makes it because she throws mushrooms into the mix and it kills the consistency.</P>

<P>Steak and cheese is arguably the best hot sandwich with a close contender being the chicken parm sub, but when you add bacon and banana peppers with pepperjack cheese and hot sauce drizzled on the top all rolled into a wrap grilled to perfection you have the best hot sandwich ever made. This sub was my lunch 3 times a week in the summer when I worked at the skipper restaurant as a waiter.</P>
