<P>Coming from a place where there isn't much to do as a kid, I picked up several hobbies that I have been doing for years. For one, I have been dirtbiking since I was four years old starting on a Suzuki 50cc and a 110cc, moving on to a long line of Hondas which I have come to love, however I'll always be a Zuki guy.

<P>I have always been an outdoorsy kid and I have loved the mountains since the first time I went to New Hampshire. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old and I have spent thousands of my own personal money to buy new bindings, decks, goggles, and other gear that I have accumulated a surplus of. The current board I ride is a Travis Rice Lib Tech all mountain deck that I have brought all the way to Colorado and all over the northeast.</P>
